# OF Exercise

This exercise utilizes redux-sagas, reselect and styled components and is aimed to provide a good understanding of a real-world like screen implementation approach.

This uses data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com mock api.

## Usage

- Fork the repo
- Install dependencies
- `yarn start`
- In the web interface that will open afterwards - run on a simulator of your choosing
- Push the fork to submit the results

## Tasks

- Add an ability to move between users from the mock api using the arrows on screen
- Load a list of posts made by user

## Bonus points

- Navigate to post screen when tapping on post
- Post screen contains the original post info on the top and a list of comments on the bottom.
- User should be able to go back to  the user they were browsing by tapping a back button in the top left corner of the screen.
- Share post styles between the post item in the main user screen and the post screen.
- Share the post response typings between main user screen and the post screen.
  
Have fun :)
